# API: California's Surfing Spots

* Peer exercise
* I partnered up with Jan. We worked on the same surfing spot API but we decided to implement it separately while helping each other and advancing at the same speed.

## Duration

June 6th and 7th. 

## Difficulties

* Unfinished: generating a random spot card.
* Trying not to spend too much time on styling.
* Sorting out the JSON response alphabetically.   

## Feedback

In a previous exercise (Pokedex), I used the XMLHttp request. This time we had to use fetch() and it's much easier.

The reason why I didn't work directly with Jan is that we didn't find a way to divide the work. Each instruction was dependent on the previous one, so working on separate tasks at the same time was not really possible.
